# Advisory check: do newly-added .md files carry a Prima-clock provenance stamp?
# Not a linter, not a blocker. Reports what's missing so it can be added by hand.
#
# Prima-clock format already in use across the repo (see prima-clock/registry.md,
# LICENSE.md, NOTICE.md, valuation/*.md): a "Prima-clock:" line containing one or
# two 12-digit YYYYMMDDHHMM stamps, e.g.
#   Prima-clock: 202608021015
#   Prima-clock: 202607290200 → 202607290523 | Iteration: Blackjack 21 | ...
#   Prima-clock: ~202606231600 → 202606242044 | ...
# The LAST 12-digit run on the line is treated as the current stamp.
#
# Only checks files newly added since BASE — existing undated files are never
# retroactively flagged. No state file, no bot commits: this repo's CI doesn't
# commit back to itself, and this check doesn't start.
